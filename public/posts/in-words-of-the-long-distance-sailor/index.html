Sometimes when I was at home I would jump out of bed and try to figure out where I was.
I would look out the windows, see houses and trees and begin to panic.
I would try to find the tiller, turn away from the land.
Then I would wake up, standing there, and it would come to me that I wasn&rsquo;t on the boat.
This made me realize I was a lot more afraid of sailing than I admitted, and the fears I was hiding came to the surface in the dark.

But I knew, I knew. If I sailed far enough, if I didn&rsquo;t crash my boat against some rocks, I would put my anchor out in some foreign land.
I would climb a hill and meet a goatherd.
We would sit under a tree, drink wine and eat goat&rsquo;s cheese.
He wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of Chernobyl or disposable diapers, and I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him.

He would tell me his story and I would tell him mine.
We would look at the hills, the sky.
And I would walk down the hill with the fine touch of a natural person, someone who belongs to the earth, to the sea.
Someone beyond the reach of the evening news.
