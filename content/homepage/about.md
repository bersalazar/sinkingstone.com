"When you throw a stone into the water, it hurries by the swiftest possible path to the bottom.
It is like this when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolve. He does nothing — he waits, he thinks, he fasts — but he passes through the things of this world _like a stone through water_, without doing anything, without moving; he is drawn and lets himself fall [...].
It is what fools call magic and think is performed by demons. Nothing is performed by demons; there are no demons.
Anyone can perform magic. Anyone can reach their goals if they can think, if they can wait, if they can fast."

—**Siddhartha, a character by Hermann Hesse**
