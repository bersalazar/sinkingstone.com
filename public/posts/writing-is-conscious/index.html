Speaking is natural. We do it unconsciously, most of the times.
Words flow out with little reflection.
It&rsquo;s an exposure of habits within us.
Writing is not natural.
There&rsquo;s a sense of watching yourself think while you&rsquo;re doing it.
The need to structure thoughts into the finger&rsquo;s mechanical motions is separate from spoken sentences.
A self-consciousness that interrupts the movement of your thoughts.
Writing that&rsquo;s meant to mimic the flow of spoken language is composed of short and rhythmic sentences.
Very few multi syllabic words.
It means the writer is aware of the reader&rsquo;s attention and understanding.
More than avoiding complex sentences and technical words, what captivates readers is rhythm.
The writer&rsquo;s capacity to inject cadence and grant breathing room." />
