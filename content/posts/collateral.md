The rock is emotionless.

It's out there, existing. It doesn't change because of our feelings or desires.

Like the floor beneath the dancer, a blacksmith's hammer or thermodynamics laws.

It won't change its shape or respond to complaints. It won't flinch.

The changing entities are within our bodies: fingers, shoulders, tendons.

With enough repetitions, they become stronger.

Mixed with patience, goals are achievable. That's a good compromise but it's not the best one.

The truly fulfilling skill comes as a realization at a given point in the path of habit.

As more of a "Oh OK, I can do this" rather than "Hooray, I just did this."

The best kind of gratification is a realization in the middle of a recurring process.

A second-hand effect. A collateral of enjoying an acquired habit.
