Small acts of kindness and love.
Why Bilbo Baggins? I don&rsquo;t know.
Perhaps because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.&rdquo;
&ndash;Gandalf, a character by J.R.R. Tokien
&ldquo;When you throw a stone into the water, it hurries by the swiftest possible path to the bottom.
It is like this when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolve. He does nothing — he waits, he thinks, he fasts — but he passes through the things of this world like a stone through water, without doing anything, without moving; he is drawn and lets himself fall [&hellip;].
It is what fools call magic and think is performed by demons. Nothing is performed by demons; there are no demons.
Anyone can perform magic. Anyone can reach their goals if they can think, if they can wait, if they can fast.&rdquo;
