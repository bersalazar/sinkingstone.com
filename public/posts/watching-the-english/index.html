After having worked day-to-day, for a few years now with them, I found this book&rsquo;s arguments about the English to be very true and relatable.
As I grow older I&rsquo;ve become more practical in behavior, thought and speak, and after reading this book I realize this collides with the author&rsquo;s description of English social patterns.
In them, there&rsquo;s a constant tendency towards indirectness, humor, self-deprecation, appearance of modesty and, moreover, moderation when arguing, greeting or expressing themselves.
This makes the real intention and meaning behind the words spoken to come from a complex interpretation of voice tonality, context and body language, along with the actual spoken word.
This applies for many cultures, yes, but in my opinion, it&rsquo;s far more present in this one.
As the author defines it, it&rsquo;s due to a &lsquo;social dis-ease&rsquo;.
Culturally, the English don&rsquo;t seem to be comfortable in social situations and have historically developed a set of mechanisms to constantly &lsquo;save-face&rsquo; in social interactions.
It&rsquo;s a culture of &lsquo;coping with&rsquo;, where appearances of positivism or eagerness for activities are rare.
Attitudes seem driven by the feeling of the world being a nuisance that has to be coped with. These mechanisms tilt the emotional bar towards a perception of moderation in everything.
It doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no emotion, it just feels like it.
It&rsquo;s as Roger Waters wrote in Pink Floyd&rsquo;s Time: &ldquo;Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.&rdquo;" />

As the author defines it, it’s due to a ‘social dis-ease’. Culturally, the English don’t seem to be comfortable in social situations and have historically developed a set of mechanisms to constantly ‘save-face’ in social interactions. It’s a culture of ‘coping with’, where appearances of positivism or eagerness for activities are rare. Attitudes seem driven by the feeling of the world being a nuisance that has to be coped with.
