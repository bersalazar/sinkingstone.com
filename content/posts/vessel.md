We traverse the world in a vessel.

The vessel is home and has multiple windows.

Each window, a view of the world.

Each, a unique process and experience.

The windows are many, but we control which one is used.

No window is a wrong choice.

We're composers of a symphony. Conductors of an orchestra.

We're free to choose from an assortment of instruments.

Each with its unique cadence, flavour, texture.

Each entering and exiting the symphony at a moment's request.
