> Sometimes when I was at home I would jump out of bed and try to figure out where I was.
> I would look out the windows, see houses and trees and begin to panic.
> I would try to find the tiller, turn away from the land.
> Then I would wake up, standing there, and it would come to me that I wasn't on the boat.
> This made me realize I was a lot more afraid of sailing than I admitted, and the fears I was hiding came to the surface in the dark.

> But I knew, I knew. If I sailed far enough, if I didn't crash my boat against some rocks, I would put my anchor out in some foreign land.
> I would climb a hill and meet a goatherd.
> We would sit under a tree, drink wine and eat goat's cheese.
> He wouldn't have heard of Chernobyl or disposable diapers, and I wouldn't tell him.

> He would tell me his story and I would tell him mine.
> We would look at the hills, the sky.
> And I would walk down the hill with the fine touch of a natural person, someone who belongs to the earth, to the sea.
> Someone beyond the reach of the evening news.
