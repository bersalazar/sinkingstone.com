Essentialism, or how to discern the vital few from the trivial many.
This book is a worthy guide to choosing the right actions, removing obstacles and making execution effortless.
In a wider context of books about de-cluttering our life and finding the core intent of living a fulfilling life, this one has served me as a true compilation of the bigger message.
It&rsquo;s practical, full of quotes from other works and real-life situations where either a problem or a solution via essentialism is applied.
It feels like a light read —because it&rsquo;s so well redacted and edited— but it has a depth and very relatable sense to it.
Some of my key takeaways:

Routines, once in place, are the gifts that keep on giving.
Focus on small wins and repetition, rather than the objective.
Make peace with the fact that saying &rsquo;no&rsquo; means trading popularity for respect.
When people make their problem our problem, we&rsquo;re not helping, we&rsquo;re just enabling.
Routinely create space to contemplate and remove the habit of always keeping the mind entertained.

This book is definitely a foundational brick for building a house of discipline, fortitude and fulfillment." />
