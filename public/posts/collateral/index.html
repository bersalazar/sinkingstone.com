	<meta name="description" content="The rock is emotionless.
It&rsquo;s out there, existing.
It doesn&rsquo;t change because of our feelings or desires.
Like the floor beneath the dancer, a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer or thermodynamics laws.
It won&rsquo;t change its shape or respond to complaints.
It won&rsquo;t flinch.
The changing entities are within our bodies: fingers, shoulders, tendons.
With enough repetitions, they become stronger.
Mixed with patience, goals are achievable.
That&rsquo;s a good compromise but it&rsquo;s not the best one.
The truly fulfilling skill comes as a realization at a given point in the path of habit.
As more of a &ldquo;Oh OK, I can do this&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Hooray, I just did this.&rdquo;
The best kind of gratification is a realization in the middle of a recurring process.
A second-hand effect.
A collateral of enjoying an acquired habit." />
