It takes a certain frame of mind and the experiences that come with age to embrace stoicism as a philosophy for life.
This book is an introduction and, moreover, a practical guide.
It’s a well paced and informative piece.
It discusses common questions and tackles the skepticism that arises when reading about or adopting a stoic life.
It’s a base for those unaware of its principles and it&rsquo;s certainly a first step on the path of discovery and understanding the work of great thinkers like Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca.
It&rsquo;s filled with insights on how to balance stoic ideas and behaviours with our day-to-day.
Personally, it&rsquo;s one of the most quotable books I’ve ever read.
I found myself making annotations on almost every page. I do feel that it makes for a better experience if whoever reads it can relate to the subjects and stoicism in general on a personal level.
These days people may not see the need to adopt a philosophy for life.
Instead, we spend our days working with the goal of affording the latest consumer gadget.
We resolute to believe that if we buy enough, we will have a life both meaningful and maximally fulfilling.
These, instead, tend to lead to a life plagued with anger, anxiety, fear, grief and envy, which for stoicism, will not be a good life." />
