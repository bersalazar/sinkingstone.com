Thoughts dwindled in the unsaid.

On things I could enable that would help coping with the fight: exotic places, experiences.

I thought of the futility of cell-killing chemicals.

Those that repair the broken bridge ahead with wood from next one.

I thought of depleting emergency funds. Of justified lies for the promise of expense coverage.

I even thought of rotten cells dying by glucose starvation.

Solutions are task forces, navigating in the vast ocean of the mind.

Entertainment, the clouds above them.

They are cleared by warm water and solitude, sadly, reactive. Void of forecast or planning.

Those which would have been granted by negative visualization.

Instead, apathy and a twisted rhetoric is the reality. An ignored burden.
