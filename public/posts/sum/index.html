I found out about this book thanks to Derek Sivers&rsquo; journal.
It&rsquo;s his highest rated book, and was really interested in it after reading its premise.
It&rsquo;s in a short story format, each of them with a version explaining what happens after we die.
They&rsquo;re unusual, creative and packed with analogies to philosophical thought or existentialist proposals that don&rsquo;t necessarily change or get resolved after we die.
God is often humanised, heaven is often treated as a mundane society filled with similar vices that we endure during life and the afterlife is sometimes a multi-dimensional, uncontrollable and even insignificant existence." />
