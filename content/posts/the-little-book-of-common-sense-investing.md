"One man may be more cunning than another, but not more cunning than everybody else."

A Benjamin Franklin quote that aptly summarizes this little jewel of a book.

Successful investing is much less about skilfully reading and beating the market in short bursts of savvy, and essentially much more about focusing on the entire market with patience, discipline and common sense.

The game ends up being easier to play than expected.

It's the next step after reading and applying the techniques from "financial peace" books like Dave Ramsey, Andrew Tobias or The Barefoot Investor, as it dives deeper in detail of the "growth" phase that all these have in common.
