	<meta name="description" content="We&rsquo;re granted the freedom to become lords of the realm of our thoughts.
Lords of our skull-sized kingdom.
There are many types of freedom.
Ones focus on winning, achieving and displaying.
Others focus on us being the center of the universe.
One where there&rsquo;s no experience, where we&rsquo;re not the protagonist.
The truly important kind is the one which involves attention.
Awareness, discipline, caring for others. Thinking.
Thinking demands the ability to control focus.
The ability to learn. The ability to master thoughts.
To exercise control over how and what to think.
The mind is an excellent servant but a terrible master.
A lifelong objective is to master our thoughts.
To avoid the ramblings of the inner voices that plague us.
Voices concerned with the future and past.
Voices that wander around in the impressions that others have of us.
They&rsquo;re blind to what&rsquo;s present, to what exists now.
They&rsquo;re fish oblivious to the water they&rsquo;re swimming in." />
