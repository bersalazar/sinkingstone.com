It&rsquo;s in a short story format, each of them with a version explaining what happens after we die. They&rsquo;re unusual, creative and packed with analogies to philosophical thought or existentialist proposals that don&rsquo;t necessarily change or get resolved after we die.
God is often humanised, heaven is often treated as a mundane society filled with similar vices that we endure during life and the afterlife is sometimes a multi-dimensional, uncontrollable and even insignificant existence." />
