Not only an excellent read, but a complete experience.

While reading about our origins and reasons behind our behaviours as individuals and as societies, I couldn’t help constantly thinking to myself: "well, that makes total sense".

We’re hard-wired by our collective knowledge, slaves to our self-created imagined orders, thinking and believing in the rules the human species has set out across generations past.

They have come organically as a consequence of progress, technology and our need for expansion.

This book shows the biological and completely objective reasons behind culture, ideology, technology, happiness, decisions, and makes a strong case of what our future might look like.
