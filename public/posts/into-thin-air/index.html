Just like a mountain climber attempting the Everest summit, this book builds on tension as you progress deeper into it.
It has build-up, creating a composition of emotions that would be similar to the experiences of those who faced the 1996 tragedy.
Krakauer makes what I consider is a valid argument on the fact that the story is not something out of the ordinary for the average Everest climbing seasons.
People die every year while trying to reach the top.
It also explicitly states how dangerous the attempt is for amateurs and professionals alike, every year, and it implies that other deaths carry a similar set of causes.
It is something I found realistic, accurate, and quite enjoyed from Krakauer&rsquo;s writing style." />
