It's a core tenet of investing.

It should be engrained in anyone entering the game of equities and trading.

It's any broker's safeword when entering business with customers.

It's the small letter in any index fund's KIID.

Some people make a case on the fact that yes, this phrase is certain, but historical trends also bear weight.

I'd modify the quote to be:

> Past performance is no guarantee of future results... but don't stop looking.

What it means is, always keep in mind that _anything_ can happen and that you cannot rely on history to predict future performance.

However, study the past. The insights of what happened at a certain point in the history of the equities markets is useful to combat uncertainty and as a guide through decisions.

2022 is an example:

Inflation is the highest its been in recent years. We've entered a bear market. Possibly will enter a recession.

Nick Maggiuli ([OfDollarsAndData.com](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/)) went back to 1926 and analyzed a similar scenario:

> going back to 1926, you will discover that stocks tend to underperform their historical averages following a high inflation period.

This does not predict what will happen but at a time of uncertainty, at a time when the question "What the fuck should I do in these situations?", this information is very insightful.

It helps reducing the emotional response to the market fluctuations that provoke panic selling.
