I used to think of Linus Torvalds as a mystical genius that single handedly built a whole revolutionary operating system.

It just turns out to be one of the most grounded and simple-philosophy minded, remarkable people, who just worked with passion on something to solve what he saw problems for him.

The success of Linux is just a side effect of him trying to fix holes in the road.

And what for me is the major side effect of his way of thinking in practice: the rise of open source.

Fun story, although it reaches his history to around 2000's. It would be great to have his continuation of the more recent decade, with the prominence of his other major creation: Git.
