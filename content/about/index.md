I'm Bernardo.

I write about whatever excites me, which is mostly ruminations of stuff I've read in books or seen in films.

I'm a software engineer, [film enthusiast](https://letterboxd.com/sinkingstone) and spare-time [music maker](https://linktr.ee/berniroco)

If you find what's written here exciting and want to talk about it, [email me](mailto:sinkingstone44@gmail.com)!

"When you throw a stone into the water, it hurries by the swiftest possible path to the bottom.
It is like this when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolve. He does nothing — he waits, he thinks, he fasts — but he passes through the things of this world _like a stone through water_, without doing anything, without moving; he is drawn and lets himself fall [...].

Anyone can perform magic. Anyone can reach their goals if they can think, if they can wait, if they can fast."
