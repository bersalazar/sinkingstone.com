Not all content consumption is passive.
Good books, films, journalism, videos, podcasts, etc., encourage you to think critically.
When you&rsquo;ve finished a book or an album, there should be a period of time for you to reflect on what you&rsquo;ve experienced.
You should have a break to let your mind wander, to examine your response, to write your thoughts down, to discuss them with others.
That&rsquo;s one reason I love seeing movies at the theater.
We talk about preserving the communal experience of watching movies,
but what about when the movie ends, that ritual of slowly getting up, emerging into the lobby, and waiting until someone finally says,
&ldquo;So what did you think?&rdquo;
The conversation that follows, in the car rider home or over drinks at a bar, is what makes the passive viewing experience active.
