	<p>Writing is not, and can never be, something natural.</p>
<p>Speaking is natural. We do it unconsciously, most of the times.</p>
<p>Words flow out with little reflection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exposure of habits within us.</p>
<p>Writing is not natural.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of watching yourself think while you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>The need to structure thoughts into the finger&rsquo;s mechanical motions is separate from spoken sentences.</p>
<p>A self-consciousness that interrupts the movement of your thoughts.</p>
<p>Writing that&rsquo;s meant to mimic the flow of spoken language is composed of short and rhythmic sentences.</p>
<p>Very few multi syllabic words.</p>
<p>It means the writer is aware of the reader&rsquo;s attention and understanding.</p>
<p>More than avoiding complex sentences and technical words, what captivates readers is rhythm.</p>
<p>The writer&rsquo;s capacity to inject cadence and grant breathing room.</p>

<p>Another breeding ground for novel-thinking, self-assesment and of how we think about social behaviour.</p>
<p>Concepts are explained from the perspective of behavioural economics and psychology.
Some can be found, in different words, in philosophy.</p>
<p>It simply enlarges the significance of both areas of study.
Individual and social behaviour is evaluated from two ends producing similar conclusions.</p>
<p>Behaviour is a product of biology and environment.
The mind is a series of electrical impulses that live in the brain and are ruled by physical laws.
There&rsquo;s nothing supernatural about it.</p>
<p>Its study from a social science perspective grants scientific method to questions that have been asked by philosophy.
&ldquo;What is the meaning of life?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is happiness?&rdquo; These are historically debated by philosophers.
To behavioural economists, they&rsquo;re measurable experiments.</p>
<p>Two selves, the experiencing and the remembering, shape the perception of happiness.
They expose how complicated it is to reach a quick, objective answer.</p>
<p>Flow state, when seen as the engine of happiness, is a representation of the experiencing self.
The more our focus lives in it, the better we feel about anything.</p>
<p>This is not what usually happens to us.
We struggle to focus on the experiencing self and our focus is pushed by genetics and evolution towards the remembering self.
The one that sources pleasant emotions but also the one that makes our thoughts wonder in the past and in the future.
The source of anxiety, fears and doubts.
The ingredients of an unhappy life.</p>

	<p>Thoughts dwindled in the unsaid.</p>
<p>On things I could enable that would help coping with the fight: exotic places, experiences.</p>
<p>I thought of the futility of cell-killing chemicals.</p>
<p>Those that repair the broken bridge ahead with wood from next one.</p>
<p>I thought of depleting emergency funds. Of justified lies for the promise of expense coverage.</p>
<p>I even thought of rotten cells dying by glucose starvation.</p>
<p>Solutions are task forces, navigating in the vast ocean of the mind.</p>
<p>Entertainment, the clouds above them.</p>
<p>They are cleared by warm water and solitude, sadly, reactive. Void of forecast or planning.</p>
<p>Those which would have been granted by negative visualization.</p>
<p>Instead, apathy and a twisted rhetoric is the reality. An ignored burden.</p>

	<p>We&rsquo;re granted the freedom to become lords of the realm of our thoughts.</p>
<p>Lords of our skull-sized kingdom.</p>
<p>There are many types of freedom.</p>
<p>Ones focus on winning, achieving and displaying.</p>
<p>Others focus on us being the center of the universe.</p>
<p>One where there&rsquo;s no experience, where we&rsquo;re not the protagonist.</p>
<p>The truly important kind is the one which involves attention.</p>
<p>Awareness, discipline, caring for others. Thinking.</p>
<p>Thinking demands the ability to control focus.</p>
<p>The ability to learn. The ability to master thoughts.</p>
<p>To exercise control over how and what to think.</p>
<p>The mind is an excellent servant but a terrible master.</p>
<p>A lifelong objective is to master our thoughts.</p>
<p>To avoid the ramblings of the inner voices that plague us.</p>
<p>Voices concerned with the future and past.</p>
<p>Voices that wander around in the impressions that others have of us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re blind to what&rsquo;s present, to what exists now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fish oblivious to the water they&rsquo;re swimming in.</p>

<p>Derek Sivers provides 27 conflicting answers put in gentile, concise words but are packed with philosophy, consciousness and meaning.</p>
<p>His words function as an elegant boxer, well-trained and efficient, throwing precise jabs at an opponent.
The opponent being our anxious, doubtful or prejudiced thoughts, wondering if any of life&rsquo;s paths are the correct one.</p>

	<p>The rock is emotionless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out there, existing.
It doesn&rsquo;t change because of our feelings or desires.</p>
<p>Like the floor beneath the dancer, a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer or thermodynamics laws.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t change its shape or respond to complaints.
It won&rsquo;t flinch.</p>
<p>The changing entities are within our bodies: fingers, shoulders, tendons.</p>
<p>With enough repetitions, they become stronger.</p>
<p>Mixed with patience, goals are achievable.
That&rsquo;s a good compromise but it&rsquo;s not the best one.</p>
<p>The truly fulfilling skill comes as a realization at a given point in the path of habit.</p>
<p>As more of a &ldquo;Oh OK, I can do this&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Hooray, I just did this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best kind of gratification is a realization in the middle of a recurring process.</p>
<p>A second-hand effect.
A collateral of enjoying an acquired habit.</p>

<p>When starting out learning a new skill, referencing professionals and people at the top of the game isn&rsquo;t the most efficient way to learn.</p>
<p>The skills are so advanced it&rsquo;s hard to find techniques than can be practiced which are appropriate to the current level.
Knowing how to bridge the gap between beginner and expert is a skill of its own. Oswaldo Zuniaga&rsquo;s The Crux is a book that&rsquo;s just about bridging this gap.</p>
<p>Watching professionals at work is enough for entertainment but should be considered with care as a resource for learning.
If so, it can be easy to fall quickly into frustration due to the relatively slow learning and skill-acquiring process.</p>
<p>At this stage in my rock climbing journey, I get pretty much the same experience and learning than non-climbers from watching an Adam Ondra video sending Silence or Alex Honnold&rsquo;s free soloing El Capitan.
They&rsquo;re such highly technical climbs and the mental challenge so large, that it&rsquo;s hard for me to take notice of something practical that would make me improve.
That&rsquo;s where guys like Oswaldo come in.
They provide the substance that lowers the barrier of entry for amateurs and enthusiasts like me, who do this as a non-professional activity.</p>
<p>The Crux pours even more magic into bridging the skills gap as it also covers mental and philosophical aspects inherent to rock climbing and nicely relates to other aspects of life itself.</p>

<p>This book makes a very efficient case that subjectiveness is not only bound to individuals but is also present in our social consciousness.
It distorts our world-view on the important aspects that drive progress, and more immediately, help us understand problems.</p>
<p>The way we deal with world-wide problems through unsupported claims stems from our primitive brain and tribal thinking.
It&rsquo;s natural for our species. Even if claims are highly technical and based on the rational, if facts are incorrect, we&rsquo;ll be going down the wrong path.
Maps are a great piece of technology but even if we firmly believe in the practical uses of maps, if the map we&rsquo;re following is faulty, we&rsquo;d be going the wrong way.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed most of this book is its structure.
It&rsquo;s creative for framing the problem but also very efficient on its arguments and facts around them.
Books that dwell on technicalities and are meant for a general audience —in this case economics, data interpretation and statistics— should take reference from this one.
There&rsquo;s no absolute need to reveal the technicals behind some arguments.
It would make the book diverge from its intention, potentially boring or scaring away readers.</p>

					<h1 class="title"><a href="/posts/the-old-man-and-the-sea/">The Old Man And The Sea - by Ernest Hemingway</a></h1>
					<time>Jan 29, 2021</time>
					<br><div class="description">

<p>This story can be interpreted in two ways: a proud and courageous man in the pursuit of an achievement to the very end, defeating odds with discipline and perseverance in spite of risks or, a stubborn and foolish man, filled with wishful thinking, in a fight against his own ego, sense of purpose and external recognition.</p>
<p>I lean towards the latter.
An old fisherman, haunted by feelings of an unfulfilling life, who goes out to sea on his chore and ends up entering a search for the ultimate rush, a grand prize that would earn him external recognition, set probably by his cultural context but ultimately by himself, in a battle against undefeatable nature.</p>
<p>Regarding writing style, I found beauty in how words flow through the old man&rsquo;s actions and his thoughts.
I found myself fully immersed in the character.
I empathized with the constant battle between two sides: animal and rational.
In this case, it&rsquo;s the animal side that pulls the old man to the path of survival.
The right path.
It&rsquo;s the side that&rsquo;s constantly reminding him: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re tired&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re losing energy&rdquo;, &ldquo;go back&rdquo;, &ldquo;leave the fish&rdquo;, &ldquo;you will die.&rdquo;
On the other side, and which differentiates us from animals, the disregard for survival that can only come from the human capacity to &ldquo;rationalize&rdquo; objectives, even if fulfilling them means death.
It&rsquo;s the side that goes: &ldquo;suck it up&rdquo;, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t give up&rdquo;, &ldquo;almost there&rdquo;, &ldquo;you will win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful to read the old man&rsquo;s foolish drive to bring the fish back.
It reminded me of stories Mount Everest climbers that, after peaking, died on the down-climb.
The thoughts of peaking blinds to the fact that climbing down is as challenging as climbing up.
Not on the physical potency required, but because by the time they peaked, their bodies are so exhausted that survival hangs on a thread.
The end of the journey is not reaching the peak, it&rsquo;s the surviving the round trip.</p>
<p>Ego is a character within us, constantly arguing why we do anything.
In the case of mountain climbers and in the case of the old man, ego is a foolish, self-interested advisor.
If not careful, it will care only about peaking, or about catching a fish and bringing it back.
Ego is satisfied, then abandons the body to fend for itself.
Should we allow ego to put a blindfold and take the driver&rsquo;s seat?</p>
