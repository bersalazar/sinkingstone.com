	<meta name="description" content="Nature is associated with gifts from Earth&rsquo;s lands and oceans.
Forests thick with greens and browns.
Streams cutting through rock and dirt.
Paw prints forming lines in white vastness.
The world untouched by human inhabitance. That&rsquo;s nature.
But also, whatever comes naturally is nature.
Feelings and actions embraced at lightning thought.
Effortless habits built by infinite loops.
Essence, instincts and impulse.
Artificial means can become something natural.
It is not natural to allow an ill body to find cures by itself.
It is natural to treat disease and infection with tools and expert&rsquo;s wit.
Artificial becomes natural.
A human brain is capable of complex relationships beyond binary genders.
Behaviors once oppressed, now understood and slowly embraced.
They become as natural as celebrating Christmas in December.
Or watching a flock of pigeons swarming a busy city park.
Acceptance becomes natural.
