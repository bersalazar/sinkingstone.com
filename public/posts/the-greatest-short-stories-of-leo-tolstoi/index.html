There are no evil characters is Tolstoy&rsquo;s short stories, only actions (or lack there of) that leads them in the wrongful paths.
Most of the stories set up scenarios where, through compassion, care for others and selflessness, people achieve true happiness, or, in Tolstoy&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;they find God&rdquo;.
From my point of view this means finding joy and fulfillment.
And as narrated in &ldquo;Ivan the fool&rdquo; or in &ldquo;Two old men&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not usually the traditionally known path, but the one where the characters have surrendered selfish desires or simply have stopped caring about leading lives according to external factors." />
