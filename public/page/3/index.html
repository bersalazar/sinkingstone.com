					<time>Oct 16, 2020</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>I saw an interview with George R.R. Martin and learned how art should not be a democracy. He was asked if fans influence his writing at any point.
He replied &ldquo;not so much&rdquo; but the subtext was &ldquo;absolutely not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained how it&rsquo;s frustrating for an artist in Hollywood –a writer, in this case– when audiovisual arts are treated as a product.
Scripts need market tests and adaptation so it has traction within a certain audience and market. An artist is not free in this context.
It&rsquo;s impossible to express artistic intuition when external factors are constantly routing your decisions or your finalized work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped trusting awards for any form of art. Their intention may be to project artistry but suffer the consequence of marketing and a profit-driven mindset.
Why are these awards given out yearly? Why is an acting category split in gender while a writing or directing category is not? When sold as a product, a piece of art&rsquo;s quality needs some form of measurement so the public&rsquo;s uncertainty of invested time and money is predictable.
Awards provide this measurement.</p>
<p>However, in their pure artistic intention, some films, recordings, paintings and books do not become relevant until they&rsquo;ve passed the test of time; until they are digested individually and culturally after years.
Some works aren&rsquo;t relevant in the time they&rsquo;re released, but become so much years later. And even in a more pure form, art may not be meant to be appreciated by a mass audience.
It may not be meant for a public consensus. Some forms of it are an expression that exists and are appreciated for what they are, nothing more.</p>

					<time>Oct 7, 2020</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>I was recently grazing through a Youtube&rsquo;s video comments section and got caught by one listing a range of emotions displayed in the video. The list is: brokenness, wishful, regret, shattered, demand, anger, hope, reality, disbelief, denial, rage, sadness and emotionless.</p>
<p>I like this list. It&rsquo;s a sum of emotions that I&rsquo;ve learned are controllable, expectable and manageable when following stoic principles and practices. They are one extreme of the emotional spectrum. The other end is related to feelings such as euphoria, pleasure or involve activities such as daydreaming, or hoping. Stoics aim at the middle. If we practice negative visualization enough we can expect to rarely be impacted by such emotions. Their traits have already been experienced.</p>
<p>In particular, I think much less of the act of hoping. The blind hope we&rsquo;re taught in childhood, by culture or by movies. A hidden lesson of non-control over life. An opium to soothe an incapacity for action and resolve. An antagonist of fortitude and progress. If seen from a certain perspective, it&rsquo;s a lie to the mind. A habit of hoping encourages the expectation of resolve from external entities. It assigns solutions to, most likely, uncontrollable sources. Hope sabotages the capacity for creative solutions, for finding alternative paths. It blurs the &rsquo;third door&rsquo;. It means a habit of giving up control before knowing if we never really had it in the first place.</p>

					<time>Oct 3, 2020</time>
					<br><div class="description">
	
	<p>Esto es el parafraseo de algunos pasajes escritos por Juan Eslava Galán en su libro &ldquo;Historia de España contada para escépticos.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No digo que todos los políticos sean corruptos pero sí todos los partidos tradicionales: PP, PSOE, Ciudadanos, Podemos. Y el político que quiere medrar en ellos fatalmente se acaba convirtiendo en corrupto. Sea por comisión: metiendo la mano en la caja para el partido o en provecho propio, o sea por omisión: cuando conoce prácticas fraudulentas en sus compañeros y no las denuncia.
De este mismo pecado de omisión no está limpio el ciudadano que sigue votando a políticos imputados e incluso condenados. En parte del libro se habla del &ldquo;Antiguo Régimen&rdquo;, donde la aristocracia explotaba al pueblo. Ahora el pueblo es la clase media y la nueva aristocracia son los partidos corruptos y el funcionariado improductivo que vive  los pechos del Estado. El aperreado pueblo, carente de formación política, pero abrumado de impuestos, se desespera y se echa en los brazos de demagogos utópicos (como los de Podemos), quizá no tanto por ese paraíso que prometen como por vengarse de los profesionales de la política a los que consideran una panda de aprovechados, cuando no de corruptos.
Lo malo (y lo históricamente normal) es que los que llegan para terminar con la casta se convertirán en casta ellos mismos en cuanto se les dé la ocasión. Como los cerdos de Orwell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Este extracto es del penúltimo capítulo del libro, y yo en particular me puedo relacionar cercanamente. Los venezolanos hemos vivido la transición de castas en carne propia. La creación de una nueva aristocracia en los hombros de la venganza y el resentimiento. El intercambio de una banda de aprovechados por otra y todo en nuestras narices. Pero nosotros, el pueblo, como caballo con anteojeras, completamente ignorantes de las falsedades y mentiras del camino.</p>
<p>Y es aquí donde el estudio de la historia, de las ideologías, de la filosofía detrás de ellas y de la naturaleza humana me parece infinitamente más productivo y esclarecedor que seguir al día los medios noticiosos. El juego de poder es cíclico. Si aprendemos a identificar las señales del camino, en todas su transmutaciones históricas, el juego se hace más evidente y para uno es más fácil entender el status quo político y, muy probablemente, su futuro.</p>

<p>Like his other recent book &lsquo;Your Music and People&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a compilation of Derek&rsquo;s journal posts loosely related to the book&rsquo;s title. Very inspiring droplets, with each chapter standing on its own. Works very well for picking up sporadically, re-reading one or a few from time to time and getting a boost from quick, exciting and potentially life-changing lessons.</p>

<p>Essentialism, or how to discern the vital few from the trivial many.
This book is a worthy guide to choosing the right actions, removing obstacles and making execution effortless.
In a wider context of books about de-cluttering our life and finding the core intent of living a fulfilling life, this one has served me as a true compilation of the bigger message.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practical, full of quotes from other works and real-life situations where either a problem or a solution via essentialism is applied.
It feels like a light read —because it&rsquo;s so well redacted and edited— but it has a depth and very relatable sense to it.</p>
<p>Some of my key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routines, once in place, are the gifts that keep on giving.</li>
<li>Focus on small wins and repetition, rather than the objective.</li>
<li>Make peace with the fact that saying &rsquo;no&rsquo; means trading popularity for respect.</li>
<li>When people make their problem our problem, we&rsquo;re not helping, we&rsquo;re just enabling.</li>
<li>Routinely create space to contemplate and remove the habit of always keeping the mind entertained.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book is definitely a foundational brick for building a house of discipline, fortitude and fulfillment.</p>

<p>After having worked day-to-day, for a few years now with them, I found this book&rsquo;s arguments about the English to be very true and relatable.</p>
<p>As I grow older I&rsquo;ve become more practical in behavior, thought and speak, and after reading this book I realize this collides with the author&rsquo;s description of English social patterns.
In them, there&rsquo;s a constant tendency towards indirectness, humor, self-deprecation, appearance of modesty and, moreover, moderation when arguing, greeting or expressing themselves.</p>
<p>This makes the real intention and meaning behind the words spoken to come from a complex interpretation of voice tonality, context and body language, along with the actual spoken word.
This applies for many cultures, yes, but in my opinion, it&rsquo;s far more present in this one.</p>
<p>As the author defines it, it&rsquo;s due to a &lsquo;social dis-ease&rsquo;.
Culturally, the English don&rsquo;t seem to be comfortable in social situations and have historically developed a set of mechanisms to constantly &lsquo;save-face&rsquo; in social interactions.
It&rsquo;s a culture of &lsquo;coping with&rsquo;, where appearances of positivism or eagerness for activities are rare.
Attitudes seem driven by the feeling of the world being a nuisance that has to be coped with. These mechanisms tilt the emotional bar towards a perception of moderation in everything.
It doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no emotion, it just feels like it.
It&rsquo;s as Roger Waters wrote in Pink Floyd&rsquo;s Time: &ldquo;Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found out about this book thanks to Derek Sivers&rsquo; journal. It&rsquo;s his highest rated book, and was really interested in it after reading its premise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a short story format, each of them with a version explaining what happens after we die. They&rsquo;re unusual, creative and packed with analogies to philosophical thought or existentialist proposals that don&rsquo;t necessarily change or get resolved after we die.</p>
<p>God is often humanised, heaven is often treated as a mundane society filled with similar vices that we endure during life and the afterlife is sometimes a multi-dimensional, uncontrollable and even insignificant existence.</p>

<p>Incredibly inspiring.</p>
<p>A journey of self-discovery and a mild introduction to eastern philosophy.
Moreover, it&rsquo;s a beautifully phrased, entertaining prose.</p>
<p>Siddharta starts out strongly.
He&rsquo;s confident and seemingly incredibly wise for his age.
While he&rsquo;s born in the highest rank of India&rsquo;s social caste and already in a culture of devotion to the mind and body — which makes him seem like he&rsquo;s already set up to be the spiritual compass of the story — he&rsquo;s also rebellious of them.
He wants something more.
He&rsquo;s a seeker.</p>
<p>This takes him on a journey of exploration and discovery of desires and vices of what&rsquo;s referred to as the &ldquo;child people&rdquo;; experiencing abandonment, lust, wealth, greed or by ceding to the often irrational, instinctive feelings that would come from parenthood.
He meets and learns from multiple characters that shape him and who are shaped by him.</p>
<p>One of my favourite lessons comes from his meeting with Kamala, in a period when learning the art of love.
She asks him: &ldquo;What skills do you have?&rdquo;.
Siddharta, who&rsquo;s never done skilled labor, replies: &ldquo;I can fast, I can wait and I can think&rdquo;.
While seemingly worthless in a world that values status, wealth and material possessions, Siddharta&rsquo;s self-discipline, patience and wisdom grant him they keys to open all doors to achieving his goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, Kamala, when you throw a stone into the water, it hurries by the swiftest possible path to the bottom.
It is like this when Siddhartha has a goal, a resolve.
He does nothing — he waits, he thinks, he fasts — but he passes through the things of this world like a stone through water, without doing anything, without moving; he is drawn and lets himself fall.</p>

	<p>A feeling of burn on exhalation. A long gaze into the infinite.</p>
<p>It comes from time to time. Not always there, but not shy of often stopping by.</p>
<p>Last time was after watching the news. A murdered celebrity. A media explosion.</p>
<p>I knew her name, didn&rsquo;t pay much attention those days. I only knew she had fame.</p>
<p>An innocent ride of a long, bumpy road. A vicious habit of meeting subsistence by harming others.</p>
<p>The numb crowd fully domesticated. We had become comformist dystopia.</p>
<p>Experts at shrugging away horror and inconvenience. Quick to interpret, digest and forget.</p>
<p>Along with details the first drops of gut acid. A creeping burn at the base of it.</p>
<p>A familiar road. A murdered mate. A child with a permanent wound and an eternal loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one slap after the other.</p>
<p>How much we have lost by riding on the back of tyrants?</p>
<p>How little have we been taught to value life?</p>
<p>She said goodbye with kisses and a sunset background.</p>
<p>And with that, the acid ball became whole. The burn had moved around like a metastasized tumor.</p>
<p>Time turned small, distortion became evident and thoughts of falling to the impune darkness were the only ones left in my mind.</p>

<p>A book that showcases Adlerian psychology and philosophy, written in the form of a conversation between an old philosopher and a young, angry and frustrated disciple, who&rsquo;s facing disappointment from being an spectator of his unchanging and unfulfilling life.
It works very well as the philosopher&rsquo;s arguments are developed, the disciple&rsquo;s point of view is intended to be a projection of the reader&rsquo;s doubts, concerns and biased opinions.</p>
<p>Lifestyle is the tendencies of thoughts and actions in our life. One of the strongest arguments in the book is that, at all times, we&rsquo;re in full control of steering our lifestyle.
This is because it&rsquo;s a subjective interpretation of the world around us and being so, we can change it.
Lifestyle is not really an objective fact.
It&rsquo;s how we view, accept and relate to things and people.
And that&rsquo;s always within our control.</p>
<p>It argues that the root of our frustrations and feelings of inferiority always come from interpersonal relationships and their dynamics.
Failure to obtain goals, supposed traumas and feelings of incompleteness are not consequence of past experiences, on the contrary, past experiences are subjective tools we use in the present to justify those feelings.</p>
<p>It touches on &lsquo;separating tasks&rsquo;, which means dealing only with actions, thoughts and feelings that are within our control and nothing else.
By exercising this, we can achieve freedom.
This will come when we learn to avoid basing our lives, actions, feelings on the actual cause of imprisonment of our minds, the one thing that keeps away from freedom: the desire for recognition.</p>
