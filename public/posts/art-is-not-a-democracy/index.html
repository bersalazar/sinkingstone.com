He was asked if fans influence his writing at any point.
He replied &ldquo;not so much&rdquo; but the subtext was &ldquo;absolutely not.&rdquo;
He explained how it&rsquo;s frustrating for an artist in Hollywood –a writer, in this case– when audiovisual arts are treated as a product.
Scripts need market tests and adaptation so it has traction within a certain audience and market.
An artist is not free in this context.
It&rsquo;s impossible to express artistic intuition when external factors are constantly routing your decisions or your finalized work.
It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped trusting awards for any form of art.
Their intention may be to project artistry but suffer the consequence of marketing and a profit-driven mindset.
Why are these awards given out yearly? Why is an acting category split in gender while a writing or directing category is not?
When sold as a product, a piece of art&rsquo;s quality needs some form of measurement so the public&rsquo;s uncertainty of invested time and money is predictable.
Awards provide this measurement.
However, in their pure artistic intention, some films, recordings, paintings and books do not become relevant until they&rsquo;ve passed the test of time; until they are digested individually and culturally after years.
Some works aren&rsquo;t relevant in the time they&rsquo;re released, but become so much years later. And even in a more pure form, art may not be meant to be appreciated by a mass audience.
It may not be meant for a public consensus.
Some forms of it are an expression that exists and are appreciated for what they are, nothing more." />
