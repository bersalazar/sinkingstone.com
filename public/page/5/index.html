<p>It takes a certain frame of mind and the experiences that come with age to embrace stoicism as a philosophy for life.</p>
<p>This book is an introduction and, moreover, a practical guide. It’s a well paced and informative piece. It discusses common questions and tackles the skepticism that arises when reading about or adopting a stoic life.</p>
<p>It’s a base for those unaware of its principles and it&rsquo;s certainly a first step on the path of discovery and understanding the work of great thinkers like Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca. It&rsquo;s filled with insights on how to balance stoic ideas and behaviours with our day-to-day.</p>
<p>Personally, it&rsquo;s one of the most quotable books I’ve ever read. I found myself making annotations on almost every page. I do feel that it makes for a better experience if whoever reads it can relate to the subjects and stoicism in general on a personal level.</p>
<p>These days people may not see the need to adopt a philosophy for life. Instead, we spend our days working with the goal of affording the latest consumer gadget. We resolute to believe that if we buy enough, we will have a life both meaningful and maximally fulfilling. These, instead, tend to lead to a life plagued with anger, anxiety, fear, grief and envy, which for stoicism, will not be a good life.</p>

<p>I’m in the neutral camp when having an opinion about this story and its tragic end.</p>
<p>I do believe Chris was egotistic and reckless. But I also agree there’s much to learn from his philosophy and his search for truth.</p>
<p>As a fan of Tolstoy myself, I found gratifying to read about someone living and applying his own flavor of Tolstoy’s message.</p>
<p>I also believe Chris was smart enough to know what the risks were at all times, he just accepted them as part of “the adventure”.</p>
<p>I like the conclusion that, at the very end, he came into terms with the inner beast that drove him.</p>
<p>He had tested and proven himself, and was ready to come back from wandering in anonymity, possibly (and hopefully) to come to terms with his family. Sadly, the wild tundra was underestimated.</p>
<p>Life’s big challenges are defined personally, they vary vastly from person to person, and the goals can only be met by our very own standards.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s no point in judging if Chris’ story was inspiring or stupid.</p>
<p>We can just read and learn about passionately following something we believe in and relate to it in the best way we can.</p>
<p>Krakauer, as usual, narrates with great pace and insight, while including his opinions and relating to the story from his own experiences, making it a thrilling ride of a book.</p>

<p>A complete journey into European life before and between the world wars.</p>
<p>Zweig, as a true cosmopolitan, seems always at the center of history in the making, and more specifically, always close to some of the greatest artistic and literary minds of the time.</p>
<p>The book is full of easy historical narrative and deep reflections on society, which come from being so much in touch with the culture of the countries he visited.</p>
<p>He had an amazing ability to create connections on his travels, while always reflecting on his ideas of pacifism and wariness of growing authoritarian regimes such as nazi Germany and communism in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It’s heartbreaking to know this book was basically his final note, having committed suicide shortly after finishing the manuscript and being published posthumously.</p>
<p>Specially in the last chapters, it was notable his growing anguish of being forced out of his native Austria and of living as a man without a country, in the face of nazism.</p>

<p>Not only an excellent read, but a complete experience.</p>
<p>While reading about our origins and reasons behind our behaviours as individuals and as societies, I couldn’t help constantly thinking to myself: &ldquo;well, that makes total sense&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We’re hard-wired by our collective knowledge, slaves to our self-created imagined orders, thinking and believing in the rules the human species has set out across generations past.</p>
<p>They have come organically as a consequence of progress, technology and our need for expansion.</p>
<p>This book shows the biological and completely objective reasons behind culture, ideology, technology, happiness, decisions, and makes a strong case of what our future might look like.</p>

<p>Dr. Jekyll found in Mr. Hyde freedom from the restrictions of his life as a scientist and as a member of the high society.</p>
<p>It was not necessarilly for being discontent with any of them, but simply because our minds are multifacetic and complex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evident this novel has been the inspiration for many modern stories, not only of personality disorders, but of addiction and excess of quick pleasures.</p>
<p>And as in many cases, the person ends up in disgrace when the mind succumbs to these and loses control.</p>

<p>An exceptional novel for those who have experienced how misunderstood and enigmatic an person&rsquo;s mind can become when facing day-to-day a terminal illness.</p>
<p>The carer tends to consider it simply an illness, and unconsciously fills it with while lies and false optimisms.</p>
<p>The ill person, on the other hand, only wants to feel comforted, protected, understood.</p>
<p>One of Ivan Ilych&rsquo;s more valuable reflections is how intrandescent a life &ldquo;that should be&rdquo; is.</p>
<p>When wishing to go back to the truly pleasurable and good moments of his life, he finds that his joy was always far from what is usually considered valuable by society (money, power).</p>
<p>He found the worthy memories on the smallest flashes of happiness like, on his example, the first time he tasted marmalade.</p>
<p>A quote that promptly can be used to summarize his reflections on his life:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if I had been going downhill while I imagined I was going up. And that is really what it was. I was going up in public opinion, but to the same extent life was ebbing away from me. And now it is all done and there is only death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are no evil characters is Tolstoy&rsquo;s short stories, only actions (or lack there of) that leads them in the wrongful paths.</p>
<p>Most of the stories set up scenarios where, through compassion, care for others and selflessness, people achieve true happiness, or, in Tolstoy&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;they find God&rdquo;</p>
<p>From my point of view this means finding joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And as narrated in &ldquo;Ivan the fool&rdquo; or in &ldquo;Two old men&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not usually the traditionally known path, but the one where the characters have surrendered selfish desires or simply have stopped caring about leading lives according to external factors.</p>

<p>I was deeply impressed by this short story&rsquo;s capacity to take on multiple subjects on little text.</p>
<p>The remarkable part is its argument of how genius for a certain skill -chess in this case- can have its root in raw innate talent or as consequence of disciplined and frequent practice.</p>
<p>And in the case of the latter, as a side-effect of the process -detailed in a highly immersive section of the book- of white torture.</p>

<p>A completely immersive experience.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know enough about the Holocaust atrocities and this story relives it as close as I&rsquo;ve seen, including how much, in spite the war ending, the torment never goes away from the mind of a survivor.</p>
