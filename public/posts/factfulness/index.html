This book makes a very efficient case that subjectiveness is not only bound to individuals but is also present in our social consciousness.
It distorts our world-view on the important aspects that drive progress, and more immediately, help us understand problems.
The way we deal with world-wide problems through unsupported claims stems from our primitive brain and tribal thinking.
It&rsquo;s natural for our species. Even if claims are highly technical and based on the rational, if facts are incorrect, we&rsquo;ll be going down the wrong path.
Maps are a great piece of technology but even if we firmly believe in the practical uses of maps, if the map we&rsquo;re following is faulty, we&rsquo;d be going the wrong way.
What I enjoyed most of this book is its structure.
It&rsquo;s creative for framing the problem but also very efficient on its arguments and facts around them.
Books that dwell on technicalities and are meant for a general audience —in this case economics, data interpretation and statistics— should take reference from this one.
There&rsquo;s no absolute need to reveal the technicals behind some arguments.
It would make the book diverge from its intention, potentially boring or scaring away readers." />
