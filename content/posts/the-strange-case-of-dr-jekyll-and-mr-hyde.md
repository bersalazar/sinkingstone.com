Dr. Jekyll found in Mr. Hyde freedom from the restrictions of his life as a scientist and as a member of the high society.

It was not necessarilly for being discontent with any of them, but simply because our minds are multifacetic and complex.

It's evident this novel has been the inspiration for many modern stories, not only of personality disorders, but of addiction and excess of quick pleasures.

And as in many cases, the person ends up in disgrace when the mind succumbs to these and loses control.
