What is something that's real and would terrify any human?

The fact the universe exists and is absolutely indifferent to our existence.

The fact it's under no obligation to make sense to us.

> A person's character is a defense against despair.

We follow social rules to cope with the overwhelmingly terrifying __real__ nature of the world.

It not only occurs in a subconscious, instinctive level, it also occurs at a cultural level.

Religions, ideologies, tribes. They're the shield against the awareness of reality.

Actual reality.

The dangers of not having this shield "places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it."
