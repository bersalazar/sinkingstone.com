Like his other recent book 'Your Music and People', it's a compilation of Derek's blog posts loosely related to the book's title. Very inspiring droplets, with each chapter standing on its own. Works very well for picking up sporadically, re-reading one or a few from time to time and getting a boost from quick, exciting and potentially life-changing lessons.
