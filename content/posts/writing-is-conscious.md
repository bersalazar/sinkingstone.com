Writing is not, and can never be, something natural.

Speaking is natural. We do it unconsciously, most of the times.

Words flow out with little reflection.

It's an exposure of habits within us.

Writing is not natural.

There's a sense of watching yourself think while you're doing it.

The need to structure thoughts into the finger's mechanical motions is separate from spoken sentences.

A self-consciousness that interrupts the movement of your thoughts.

Writing that's meant to mimic the flow of spoken language is composed of short and rhythmic sentences.

Very few multi syllabic words.

It means the writer is aware of the reader's attention and understanding.

More than avoiding complex sentences and technical words, what captivates readers is rhythm.

The writer's capacity to inject cadence and grant breathing room.
