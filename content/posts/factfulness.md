This book makes a very efficient case that subjectiveness is not only bound to individuals but is also present in our social consciousness. It distorts our world-view on the important aspects that drive progress, and more immediately, help us understand problems.

The way we deal with world-wide problems through unsupported claims stems from our primitive brain and tribal thinking. It's natural for our species. Even if claims are highly technical and based on the rational, if facts are incorrect, we'll be going down the wrong path. Maps are a great piece of technology but even if we firmly believe in the practical uses of maps, if the map we're following is faulty, we'd be going the wrong way.

What I enjoyed most of this book is its structure. It's creative for framing the problem but also very efficient on its arguments and facts around them. Books that dwell on technicalities and are meant for a general audience —in this case economics, data interpretation and statistics— should take reference from this one. There's no absolute need to reveal the technicals behind some arguments. It would make the book diverge from its intention, potentially boring or scaring away readers.
